The 5th edition of Rock Juice from the legends at Rocky Ridge has upped the ABV a tad, and dangerously upped the flavour. Hidding the 10.5% its a sneaky dangerous way to make sure you can't drive for a week. Delicious beer, only problem is at 10.5% its super difficult to limit yourself to 1! ( I may have purchased multiple squealers while in bussleton recently...)
